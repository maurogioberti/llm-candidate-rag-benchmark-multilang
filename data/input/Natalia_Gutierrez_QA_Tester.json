  ],
  "AreasToImprove": [
    "Showcase measurable achievements (defect KPIs, coverage, cycle times, automation ROI)",
    "Deepen CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions, automated test execution in pipelines)",
    "Expand automation coverage beyond Playwright (consider Cypress for comparison)"
  ],
  "Tips": [
    "Add 3–5 measurable achievements per project (e.g., +30% test coverage, −20% UAT defects, X% automation coverage).",
    "Create public GitHub repo showcasing Playwright tests with POM pattern and API automation examples.",
    "Highlight CI/CD integration: running Playwright tests in GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines.",
    "Add reporting tools (Allure/Playwright HTML reports) and contract testing (OpenAPI/Swagger).",
    "Include BDD (Gherkin/Cucumber) and explicit regression/smoke testing strategies.",
    "Mention performance basics (JMeter/K6) and accessibility testing (WAI-ARIA, axe-core) if explored."
