  "Summary": "Full-stack web developer with ~5 years of experience including internships and junior roles, combining hands-on development (JavaScript, Node.js, React, PHP/CakePHP, SQL/Firebase) with strong design skills (Adobe, Figma). Built and shipped a responsive site (autotrego.com), supported back-end APIs, and collaborated in cross-functional environments; leadership and teaching experience complement technical breadth. Looking to deepen modern JS tooling, testing, and cloud/DevOps to grow into a solid mid-level full-stack role.",
  "Strengths": [
    "Balanced full-stack foundation across front-end and back-end",
    "Real project delivery (autotrego.com) and collaborative experience",
    "Strong design/UI background aiding developer–designer handoff",
    "Leadership and mentoring exposure (AIESEC, Assistant Teacher)",
    "Good English and multi-language communication"
  ],
  "AreasToImprove": [
    "Quantify impact with metrics (performance, conversion, load times)",
    "Strengthen automated testing and CI/CD practices",
    "Consolidate stack focus (e.g., TypeScript + React + Node) and modern tooling"
  ],
  "Tips": [
    "Add 3–5 quantified achievements (e.g., improved LCP by X%, reduced bundle size by Y%).",
    "Include a projects section with links (GitHub, live demos) highlighting React/Node and API work.",
    "List concrete tools for testing (Jest, Playwright/Cypress) and CI (GitHub Actions).",
    "Add cloud basics (AWS/Azure) and containerization (Docker) for ATS and role alignment.",
    "Refine keywords: TypeScript, REST/Swagger, Auth (JWT/OAuth), deployment pipeline."
