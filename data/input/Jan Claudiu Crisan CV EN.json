  "Summary": "Java backend developer with approximately 4 years of experience building and maintaining RESTful applications using Spring Boot/MVC/Data/Security, Hibernate, and MySQL. Delivered security implementations, code reviews, and best practices within small agile teams; contributed to POS system development and API-centric projects. Comfortable with Docker, Maven, Git/Bitbucket, and unit testing frameworks like Mockito; looking to grow in cloud, CI/CD, and microservices ecosystems.",
  "Strengths": [
    "Solid Java/Spring backend foundation with security and REST APIs",
    "Hands-on experience with relational databases and ORM (MySQL/Hibernate)",
    "Good collaboration in small agile teams with code review culture",
    "Exposure to Docker and modern build tooling (Maven)",
    "Strong English proficiency (C1)"
  ],
  "AreasToImprove": [
    "Add cloud and CI/CD tooling experience (e.g., AWS/Azure, pipelines)",
    "Strengthen automated testing with JUnit, Testcontainers, coverage metrics",
    "Gain experience with microservices patterns, messaging, and observability"
  ],
  "Tips": [
    "Quantify impact (e.g., reduced response time by X%, improved reliability, decreased defects).",
    "Add a Tech Stack per role including versions and tools (e.g., Spring Boot 2.x, JUnit5, OpenAPI, Docker).",
    "Include CI/CD exposure (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/Jenkins) and container orchestration (Kubernetes).",
    "Document API practices (Swagger/OpenAPI) and security (OAuth2/JWT, Spring Security config).",
    "Highlight any performance tuning (profiling, caching) and database migration practices (Liquibase flyway)."
